# Player Instructions

## Game
The game initializes with 7 tiles in your hand to play, and the future tiles you will pick up from after playing. 

Each tile has a corresponding score. Form a word from the tiles in your hand, dragging and dropping them into the playing slots. Your score from the word will be determined from the score corresponding to the tile, in addition to any bonus points tied to the particular slot.

The game will end once you pass without playing any words, or you cannot pull any more tiles from the sequence.
